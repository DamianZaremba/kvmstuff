KVM stuff
=========

Random scripts that might be useful for a KVM host.

They are mostly written to be used locally on the host and for a single host - they could easily be used remotly with a little rewriting however I have a different system for that.

I use these on my home KVM servers that a bunch of test machines reside on - for the production cluster I use a a RPC style framework and poll the API nodes for this data. When I get around to it I'm going to rewrite the RPC framework in part and OS it.
